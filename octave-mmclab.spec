%description
MMCLAB is the native MEX version of MMC - Mesh-based Monte Carlo - for 
MATLAB and GNU Octave. By converting the input and output files into 
convenient in-memory variables, MMCLAB is very intuitive to use and 
straightforward to be integrated with mesh generation and post-simulation 
analyses. Because MMCLAB contains the same computational codes for 
OpenCL-based photon simulation as in a MMC binary, running MMCLAB 
inside MATLAB is expected to give similar speed as running a standalone 
MMC binary using either a CPU or a GPU.

%description -n %{project}
Mesh-based Monte Carlo (MMC) is a 3D Monte Carlo (MC) simulation software 
for photon transport in complex turbid media. MMC combines the strengths
of the MC-based technique and the finite-element (FE) method: on the 
one hand, it can handle general media, including low-scattering ones, 
as in the MC method; on the other hand, it can use an FE-like tetrahedral 
mesh to represent curved boundaries and complex structures, making it
even more accurate, flexible, and memory efficient. MMC uses the
state-of-the-art ray-tracing techniques to simulate photon propagation in 
a mesh space. It has been extensively optimized for excellent computational
efficiency and portability. MMC currently supports both multi-threaded 
parallel computing and GPU to maximize performance on modern processors.
